# Assignment-3-Scalable-Machine-Learning
_Big data and machine learning coursework_

In this assignment, I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the feature space/s that I created in Assignment 2, and then generated a new feature space/s using PCA to study the performance changes of the same machine learning techniques that I used in assignment 2. I then repeated the same tasks that I performed in assignment 2 on the PCA-based feature space/s that I created in order to compare the results obtained from models with PCA and without PCA.
